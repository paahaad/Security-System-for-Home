# face_detection
Using OpenCV  we are going to detect the human face. OpenCV is open source computer vision module which can help to read the image. OpenCV convert the image to the numpy array.
we use a classifier which contain the feature of the face.(say it contain the coordinates of the face) and using the numpy array we try to look for match the of this coordination.
and this way we find the human face using OpenCV . OpenCV is available in many language, we are using python in this project.
