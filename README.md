#Security System for Home Using Rasberry Pi and Computer Vision.
OpenCV is open source computer vision module which can help to read the image. We will integrate OpneCV to Rasberry Pi,with the help of pi camera we detect the human face and set a massage to user.

Explaination:-
-Convert image to numpy array.
-Use classifier which contain the feature of the face.(say it contain the coordinates of the face) 
-Using the numpy array we try to look for match the of this coordination.
-This way we find the human face using OpenCV . 


OpenCV is available in many language, we are using python in this project. For more details see doc and ppt.
